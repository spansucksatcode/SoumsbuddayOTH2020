                    <h5>Hello, user.</h5>

                    <p>
                        I am an easter egg. My kind stays hidden in the shadows, waiting for a weary explorer to find
                        us.
                        We grant joy and surprise to those who find us.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At the gates of where you are headed, you will be asked your name, and a key.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Call the name of the game where the first of my kind hid, and the gates will open to lead you to
                        your destination.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Good luck.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        P.S: Here is another totally unsuspicious <span class="imp"><a href="/fool">surprise</a></span>.
                        You
                        might
                        already know what lies ahead.
                    </p>
